## Introduction
This notebook was created as a part of a college project by **Group No. 16**. The main objective was to explore and document **NumPy**, focusing on its utility in numerical calculations, array operations, and statistical computations.

## Features
- In-depth explanation of all NumPy functions and methods.
- Code examples demonstrating the use of NumPy for various tasks:
  - Array creation and manipulation.
  - Statistical computations.
  - Advanced indexing and slicing.
  - Linear algebra operations.
  - Random number generation.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.6 or higher.
- NumPy library (can be installed via `pip install numpy`).

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Akashmandal08/your-repository.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and open the Jupyter Notebook file (`Python_project.ipynb`):
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Python_project.ipynb
   ```
3. Explore the code and execute cells to understand various NumPy functions.
